# ConstructQA - Quick Start Commands

## üöÄ LAUNCH TODAY (15 Minutes)

### Step 1: Deploy to Vercel (5 min)

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Login
vercel login

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

**OR use the dashboard** (easier):
1. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
2. Import from GitHub
3. Add environment variables from `.env`
4. Click Deploy
5. Done! You get a live URL

---

### Step 2: Test Your Live Site (5 min)

Visit your Vercel URL and test:
- [ ] Sign up works
- [ ] Create project works
- [ ] Upload file works
- [ ] Run scan works
- [ ] Download reports work

---

### Step 3: Invite Beta Testers (5 min)

Send them:
```
üöÄ Test ConstructQA Beta

URL: https://your-app.vercel.app

1. Sign up with your email
2. Create a test project
3. Upload a sample file (IFC, DWG, PDF, etc.)
4. Run a scan
5. Download the reports

Let me know what you think!
```

## üîÑ MAKING UPDATES (Super Simple)

### Every Time You Want to Update:

```bash
# 1. Make your changes in the code

# 2. Test locally

npm run build

# 4. Commit and push (auto-deploys!)

Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows/Linux)
Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)

# Or check if deployment succeeded in Vercel dashboard
```

### Environment variables not working

## ‚ö° POWER USER TIPS

1. **Auto-deploy is magic** - Just push to GitHub, Vercel does the rest
2. **Test locally first** - Always run `npm run dev` and `npm run build`
3. **Monitor first 30 min after deploy** - Catch issues early
4. **Use preview deployments** - Run `vercel` (without --prod) to test before going live
5. **Keep environment variables in Vercel** - Never commit `.env` to GitHub
